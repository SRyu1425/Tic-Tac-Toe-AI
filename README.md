# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Project Overview
This project is a demo of an AI designed for the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, featuring an implementation of both the Minimax algorithm and its optimization using Alpha-Beta pruning. This is aimed at showing AI techniques in a familiar Tic Tac Toe setting, where the computer consistently outperforms or matches human players. Additionally, this game includes a built-in terminal-based UI.

## Features
- **Minimax Algorithm**: A standard algorithm for decision-making in game theory, providing the AI with the ability to determine the best move from any current game state.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization of the Minimax algorithm that significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated, enabling faster decision-making without sacrificing accuracy.
- **Unbeatable AI**: Through the use of these algorithms, the AI is configured to always win or draw, ensuring a challenging game for human opponents.
- **Terminal-based UI**: Offers an easy-to-use interface to play the game directly from the terminal, with multiple modes including AI vs. AI, human vs. AI, and human vs. human.

## Installation
To play the Tic Tac Toe AI game, just clone this repository and run the main.py file. No additional dependencies are required beyond the standard Python libraries.

## Usage
After running main.py, you will be asked to choose a game mode:

- **hh**: Human vs. Human
- **ha**: Human vs. AI
- **ah**: AI vs. Human (AI makes the first move)
- **aa**: AI vs. AI

Select the mode by typing the code and play the game through an interactive terminal session.
