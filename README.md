# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Project Overview
This project is a demonstration of an AI designed for the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, featuring an implementation of both the Minimax algorithm and its optimization using Alpha-Beta pruning. Aimed at showcasing AI techniques within a familiar setting, the Tic Tac Toe AI consistently outperforms or matches human players, offering a challenging opponent. Additionally, this game includes a built-in terminal-based UI, providing an accessible and intuitive interface for all users.

## Features
- Minimax Algorithm: A standard algorithm for decision-making in game theory, providing the AI with the ability to determine the best move from any current game state.
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization of the Minimax algorithm that significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated, enabling faster decision-making without sacrificing accuracy.
- Unbeatable AI: Through the use of these algorithms, the AI is configured to always win or draw, ensuring a challenging game for human opponents.
- Terminal-based UI: Offers an easy-to-use interface to play the game directly from the terminal, supporting various modes of play including AI vs. AI, human vs. AI, and human vs. human.

## Installation
To play the Tic Tac Toe AI game, simply clone this repository and run the main.py file. No additional dependencies are required beyond the standard Python libraries.

## Usage
Upon running main.py, you will be prompted to choose a mode of play:

- hh: Human vs. Human
- ha: Human vs. AI
- ah: AI vs. Human (AI makes the first move)
- aa: AI vs. AI

Select your preferred mode by typing the corresponding code and enjoy the game through an interactive terminal session.
